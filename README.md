## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

    - __Python__
        - [Stock Price Predictor (LSTM Neural Network)](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/LSTM-net-stock-predictor/README.md): A financial analysis model to predict short-term price movements for technology stocks using LSTM neural networks. Achieved 61% accuracy in predicting direction of price movements 10 minutes into the future.

	_Tools: Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy_

	- __R__
		- [Voter Turnout Prediction Pipeline](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/gb-forest-voter-predictor/README.md): Building an ensemble model to predict voter turnout on polling day for political outreach organizations. Achieved a 64.56% accuracy in identifying non-voters from large population samples.


- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

    - __R__
        - [UK Police Stop and Search](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/uk-police-stop-search-investigation/README.md): Visual analysis of racial bias in UK police stop and search practices using API data stored in relational databases.
        - [MSc Dissertation: Modeling Online Social Networks for Collective Action](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/msc_dissertation-relational-event-modeling/blob/main/README.md): An original model for measuring social media interactions in large-N networks. Analysed 5.3 million Reddit comments for academic dissertation and use in market and Internet research. Used Reddit shortsqueeze movement as a case study. 
        - [Autocratic Bank Bailouts: Financialized Pensions Research](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/academic-research/blob/main/bjps_non_dem_banking_crises/README.md): Academic paper analyzing how financialized pension schemes constrain autocratic regimes during banking crises, using deep learning for missing data imputation. 
    
    _Tools: tidyverse, igraph, SQL, survival_

- ### Natural Language Processing
    - __Python__
        - [AI Daily Briefer (Project Janice)](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/morning-brief): Building an AI-powered morning briefing system that aggregates personalized data from Gmail, Calendar, Weather, and News APIs to generate conversational audio summaries using Google's Gemini AI.

	_Tools: Pandas, Google Cloud, OAuth, SSH_

- ### Micro Projects:

	- __Python__
		- [Wikipedia Network Analyzer](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/wikipedia-network-analyzer/README.md): Parsing Wikipedia editing history to measure user interactions, reverts, and editing patterns with focus on computational efficiency.
		- [Chopstick Game-playing Agent](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/chopstick-game-playing-agent/README.md): Building a competitive game-playing agent using minimax algorithm with tree-pruning for the children's game chopsticks.
    - __R__
		- [Civil War Predictor](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/ml-civil-war-classifier/README.md): Predicting the likelihood of civil war outbreak using historical country-year data and LASSO logistic regression.
        - [Economic Policy Interventions Survey Analysis](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/academic-research/tree/main/ejpr_econ_preferences): Conjoint survey experiment conducted across Australia and UK examining public support for COVID-19 economic interventions. 
        - [Primary School Network Analysis](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/education-network-analysis/README.md): Analyzing social networks among 6th-8th grade students to understand interpersonal dynamics and social interaction patterns.
