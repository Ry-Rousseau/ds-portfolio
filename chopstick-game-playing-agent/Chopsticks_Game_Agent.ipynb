    "# Chopsticks Game AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements an AI player for a modified version of the children's hand game \"Chopsticks\" (also known as \"Fingers\"). The AI uses the minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find optimal moves in the game. This implementation focuses on a 4-hand variant of the game, where two players each control two hands (players A,B vs C,D).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core components include:\n",
    "- Game state representation and legal move generation\n",
    "- State transition logic\n",
    "- Terminal state and utility calculations\n",
    "- Heuristic evaluation function for non-terminal states\n",
    "- Alpha-beta pruning implementation for efficient search"

    "## The Game of Chopsticks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Rules\n",
    "Chopsticks is traditionally played with two players, each using their two hands. In this implementation:\n",
    "- Players control two hands each (A,B vs C,D)\n",
    "- Each hand starts with 1 finger raised\n",
    "- Players take turns tapping an opponent's hand with one of their hands\n",
    "- When a hand is tapped, the number of fingers on the tapped hand increases by the number of fingers on the tapping hand\n",
    "- If the sum exceeds 5, that hand is considered \"dead\" (value becomes 0)\n",
    "- A player loses when both of their hands are dead (value 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Move: Splitting\n",
    "This variant includes a special \"splitting\" move:\n",
    "- If a player has at least 4 fingers on one hand and their other hand is dead (value 0)\n",
    "- They can perform a split, dividing the fingers between both hands\n",
    "- Example: [4,0] → [2,2] or [5,0] → [3,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This splitting move makes the game much less predictable, and harder for an algorithm or human to solve."

    "## Performance and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI agent uses alpha-beta pruning with a depth limit of 11 moves, allowing it to make decisions quickly while still playing at a high level. The heuristic evaluation function is crucial for guiding the search when it can't reach terminal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "- **Immediate win detection**: The agent will always choose a winning move if available\n",
    "- **Strategic evaluation**: Considers hand advantages, dead hands, and tactical positions\n",
    "- **Efficient search**: Alpha-beta pruning dramatically reduces the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for improvement:\n",
    "- **Advanced heuristics**: Could incorporate more pattern recognition\n",
    "- **Learning capability**: Could adapt to opponent play styles over time\n",
    "- **Deeper search**: With optimization, could search deeper into the game tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation achieves approximately 70th percentile performance in competitions against other AI agents."

    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the application of adversarial search algorithms to create an AI agent for the game of Chopsticks. The implementation showcases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Game state representation and manipulation\n",
    "2. Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning\n",
    "3. Heuristic evaluation for non-terminal states\n",

    "The resulting agent plays at a competitive level while maintaining efficiency. This approach could be extended to other turn-based games with complete information.\n",

    "Potential enhancements include:\n",
    "- Implementing machine learning approaches (reinforcement learning)\n",
    "- Developing opening move databases\n",
