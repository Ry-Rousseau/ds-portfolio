To think about:
- Writing to database
- Get database on all stop and search data for time period for each police force 
- Then you can query it to get all the relevant statistics
- Instead of using crime statistics to determine if there is bias, you can look at the rate of arrest by stop and search


Notes on above:
- You'll have to replace the path with a path online - replicable - however all the data sources are the best available
- Remember to change the above ethnicity_data path to an original data source - its currently on the data you've pre-edited
- add in age data later on


Notes on above:
- If you have time, rename all the variables to be consistent across all dataframes
- Reference the fact that you tested the level of distortion so that it is not too extreme
- If you have time, put all the data frames into a SQL database and query it for analyses where local district code is the primary key

```
Notes on above:
- IF you want to summarize the individual ethnic bins then you can just add more to the mutate ifelse batch
- Note that if there are no ethnicity matches to the categories, it outputs an NA
- you need to add handling for the not-stated category in the data
- What if we include the mixed race people within their most visible racial category? (ie. black, white, asian, other)

Incongruencies (thigns in census data not in stop_search data):
- Gypsy and Irish Traveller is not recorded as an option in the stop search ethnicity data
- White: Roma
- Any other ethnic background: Arab

Things included in stop_search data but not in census data:
- Other ethnic group: Not stated
- NA

Dealing with NA data:
- Clearly state the proportion of stop and search records with missing ethnicity data in each district
- Consider doing a sensitivity analysis - see how different approaches to handling NA data (including vs. excluding) affect your results
- Discuss Potential Implications of NA data, are there any patterns (certain districts, time periods)

Dealing with no location data:
- This obviously makes the use of poly shapes less reliable
- use a robustness check on the rates of stop/search within the ukc_stop_search no location function

#NEXT STEPS

# 1) Aggregate the necessary crime, ethnicity data in batches so you never store a full dataframe with all the information that is being analyzed in total

# use the table in the folder on ethnicity statistics by local district area

#Pass the shs files as arguments to the API

#ukc_stop_search_poly - see usage

    #append to the dataframe
    stop_search_df <- rbind(stop_search_df, data)
